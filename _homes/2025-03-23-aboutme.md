Hello, I am **Kyoungmin Lee**, a Ph.D. student at DGIST, advised by Prof. Sunghoon Im. My research focuses on vision-language models, as well as generative models for personalized and consistent visual generation and editing..

<!-- , a contract researcher in Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI), in seoul, South Korea. I have worked on effiecnt image · text based style editing(transfer). My research interest revolve around `Computer Vision`, particularly in `Style transfer`, `Vector-Quantize based Generative Model`, and `Text-Image Multi-modal Model`. -->
